# BBD-Code-and-Documentation
The Rust paper and all the code I have written related to implementation in matlab
There are 10 files in this repository and a brief description of each follows.
1) rust_BBD.pdf is the paper I have been closely following in my implementation
2)ch_d_hr_week_viewing.txt is the file I use to pull the data I use to build the average rating for each time slot on a network for an average week.
3) week_long_viewrship.txt is the file I use to pull the week long data I use to preliminarily validate my results.
4)importnielsen_approach2.m reads in the CSV generated by ch_d_hr_week_viewing.txt and formats it as needed. 
5)multiplicative_regression.m performs the multiplicative regression described in rust_BBD.pdf based off of the data output by import_nielsen_approach2.m
6)approach_2_reach_calc.m computes the frequency distribution and reach (effective reach) of a novel schedule based on the multiplicative regression coefficients output by multiplicative_regression.m
7)import_nielsen_week.m reads in the CSV file generated by week_long_viewership.txt
8)hist_data_schedule_freq.m computes the reach and frequency distribution based on the historical data output form import_nielsen_week.m
9)validation_script.m is the code to generate the preliminary validation results.
10)detailed_description_with_code.pdf is a document containing details about the implementation and more thorough descriptions of each function in this repository.
